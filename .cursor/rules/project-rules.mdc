# Project Rules

## Package Management

- Always use `npx expo install <dependency>` for installing Expo-specific dependencies
- Do not start the dev client unless specified
- Use `pnpm` as the primary package manager for all other operations (install, run, build, etc.)
- Prefer `pnpm` over npm or yarn for consistency

## Code Style

- Use Context7 MCP to fetch the latest docs for Expo.
- Use TypeScript whenever possible.
- Use kebab-case for all file names. Avoid capital letters.
- Use @/ path aliases for imports.
- Use root src directory.
- Use TailwindCSS whenever possible.

## Project Structure

- Keep components in the `components/` directory.
- Maintain global state or store logic in the `store/` directory.
- Follow Expo Router conventions for file-based routing.
- Don't Edit anything in /ios since these are complied folders.
